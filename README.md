# NexusInkMilling
InkMilling script for Achaea's Nexus Client

This Repository has two other branches.  BasePackage and Update.  This package uses Semantic Versioning.  This means versions are formatted in a Major.Minor.Patch format.

Example: Version 1.1.0 (or 1.1)

If you have the same Major version already installed, then use the Update branch to download the updated Minor or Patch files.  Once installed in Nexus, check the README for any notes.

Once you've moved the new Minor or Patch into the InkMilling package in Nexus, you can delete the "InkMilling additon" package.
