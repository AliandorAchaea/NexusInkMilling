# NexusInkMilling Version 2
InkMilling script for Achaea's Nexus Client.  Here's why you should check it out:

+ You start with guided set up which allows:
    + Setting priority for blue reagent use.
    + Setting priority for red reagent use.
    + User selected foreground and background color options for notices from the script.
    + Ability to set whether you're using an Artifact Mill or not.

+ Keeps track of your reagents and has commands to show you how many inks you could mill with what you've got.
+ Has an alias to determine how many reagents you'll need to collect to make X amount of an ink.
+ Allows batch milling for larger amounts of inks.  Just input an amount, and the script does the rest.
+ Output gagging to limit spam.
